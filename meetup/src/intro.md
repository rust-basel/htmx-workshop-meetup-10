# Intro

We are going to introduce you [HTMX](https:///) with the rust server framework [axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum), which enables you to write reactive
web applications with ease without the need of javascript frameworks.

You can get a good grasp by looking at [fireship's 100s of HTMX video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-GSGH2RxJs).

## First Workshop Part

In this first part we will show you some basics with [axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum),
rendering html with [askama](https://github.com/djc/askama) and using [HTMX](https://htmx.org/).

In detail the first part consists of:

- Serving with [axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum).
- How to return html directly using [askama](https://github.com/djc/askama) and how [askama](https://github.com/djc/askama) works.
- How to add [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) to our html and how [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) works with small examples.

After you got the basics with server side rending and using htmx and having a good lunch,
we will hop on to the second part.

## Second Workshop Part

In the second part of the workshop you will build something yourself, without further guidance.
Of course we will help if you get stuck somewhere. Getting your hands dirty is the best way to learn.

You can mix and match server frameworks and rendering engines.
